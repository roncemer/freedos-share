## Building

I have no idea.  It's been over 20 years since I touched this project.  Probably requires either Turbo C from Borland, or there may be a way to build the FreeDOS utilities using some ported version of GCC.  Have a look at freedos.org to see if there are any instructions on how to build the utilities.

Feel free to update this document and issue a pull request to me.  I will gladly merge in your changes.
